    "Review text": "Absolutely superb meal.  Started with Greek platter which is meant for two to share.  We shared between three and there was plenty.  Salad, olives, beautiful feta and fried halloumi with dips and pitta, all really lovely.  Everyone said their main courses were lovely, including the best fillet steak one of our party said he’d ever had.  None of us could manage a pudding.  Service was excellent.  Will definitely be back",
